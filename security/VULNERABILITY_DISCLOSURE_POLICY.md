- Phishing or pretexting attacks

#### Third-Party Services
- Third-party websites or services not listed above
- Cloud provider infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- CDN services (CloudFlare, Fastly, etc.)

#### Infrastructure
- Network-level attacks (DDoS, network sniffing)
- Attacks on cloud provider infrastructure
- Physical security testing

#### Other Exclusions
- Spam or automated scanning that creates significant load
- Attacks on end users or customers
- Testing of out-of-scope systems to gain access to in-scope systems
- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (report to vendor instead)
- UI/UX bugs (unless they have security implications)
- Missing security headers without demonstrable impact
- Self-XSS without a viable attack scenario
- Known vulnerabilities without new exploit techniques
- Issues requiring physical access to victim's device
- Issues requiring MITM attacks on outdated browsers

### Special Notes

**Rate Limiting:** Our systems implement rate limiting. Please do not attempt to bypass rate limits. If you need higher limits for testing, contact us.

**Test Data:** Do not use real user data for testing. Create test accounts for all security research.

**Data Exfiltration:** Do not download or exfiltrate data beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability.

## Rules of Engagement

### What You Can Do

You are authorized to conduct security testing on in-scope systems, provided you:

1. **Comply with this policy** in its entirety
2. **Use test accounts only** - never access real user data
3. **Minimize impact** - avoid disrupting services or destroying data
4. **Stop immediately** if you encounter user data
5. **Report promptly** - disclose vulnerabilities to us first
6. **Allow time** - provide reasonable time for remediation before disclosure
7. **Maintain confidentiality** - don't share vulnerability details publicly

### What You Must NOT Do

You must NOT:

1. Access, modify, or delete data that doesn't belong to you
2. Test using accounts you don't own or have explicit permission to use
3. Perform actions that could degrade service (DoS attacks)
4. Send spam, phishing, or social engineering attempts
5. Test using automated scanners without prior approval
6. Disclose vulnerabilities publicly before we resolve them
7. Exploit vulnerabilities beyond the minimum necessary proof of concept
8. Share vulnerability details with third parties
9. Demand compensation as a condition of disclosure
10. Violate any applicable laws

### Testing Limitations

#### Automated Scanning

- **NOT ALLOWED:** Mass automated scanning without permission
- **ALLOWED:** Targeted testing with specific tools (Burp, OWASP ZAP, etc.)
- **REQUIRED:** Maintain rate limits (max 10 requests/second)

#### DoS Testing

- **NOT ALLOWED:** Any DoS or DDoS testing
- **NOT ALLOWED:** Resource exhaustion attacks
- **ALLOWED:** Demonstrating algorithmic complexity issues with minimal requests

#### Data Access

- **STOP IMMEDIATELY** if you access non-test data
- **REPORT** any accidental data access immediately
- **DELETE** any non-test data you may have downloaded
